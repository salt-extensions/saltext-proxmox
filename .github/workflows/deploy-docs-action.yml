  # The released docs are not versioned currently, only the latest ones are deployed.
  #
  # Versioning support would require either (better):
  #   * Rebuilding docs for all versions when a new release is made
  #   * Version selector support in `furo`: https://github.com/pradyunsg/furo/pull/500
  #
  # or (more basic):
  #   * using the `gh-pages` branch and peaceiris/actions-gh-pages
  #     to be able to deploy to subdirectories. The implementation via
  #     actions/deploy-pages always replaces the directory root.
